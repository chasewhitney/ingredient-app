This app will allow the user to copy and paste lists of ingredients from skincare products into a field, and then the app will rate each ingredient on its supposed level of benefit, according to my girlfriend's preferred skincare website. The app does this by pulling data from an ingredient dictionary on the skincare website, paring it down and formatting it into an array of data objects using cheerio, searching the array for the product's ingredients, and finally, listing the ingredients and their ratings using Angular.
